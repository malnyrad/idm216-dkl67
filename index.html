            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
            <p>This case study focuses on the project for IDM 216, where we were tasked with designing a food ordering app for Lennox Got Lunch, a food truck on Drexel University's campus. Using the preexisting design from IDM 215, our end goal was to create a functional web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Over the course of the 10 week term, the team developed the app, from designing the critical flow in Figma to the final deployed interactive prototype.

            <h3>Choosing Lennox</h3>
            <p>The project for IDM 216 began with the prototype design for Lennox Got Lunch from IDM 215 created by the original Lennox team. With this design serving as the baseline for our group project, our team of five was tasked with developing and deploying a functional web app; together with the team's UX designer, I was also tasked with refreshing and solidifying the Lennox brand identity to better reflect the food truck's vision while also tying in some of the original design choices.</p>
