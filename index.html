        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This case study focuses on the project for IDM 216, where we were tasked with designing a food ordering app for Lennox Got Lunch, a food truck on Drexel University's campus. Using the preexisting design from IDM 215, our end goal was to create a functional web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Over the course of 10 weeks, the team developed the app, from designing the critical flow in Figma to the final deployed interactive prototype.</p>
