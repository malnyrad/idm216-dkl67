            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
            <p>This case study focuses on the project for IDM 216, where we were tasked with designing a food ordering app for Lennox Got Lunch, a food truck on Drexel University's campus. Using the preexisting design from IDM 215, our end goal was to create a functional web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Over the course of the 10 week term, the team developed the app, from designing the critical flow in Figma to the final deployed interactive prototype.

            <h3>Choosing Lennox</h3>
            <p>The project for IDM 216 began with the prototype design for Lennox Got Lunch from IDM 215 created by the original Lennox team. With this design serving as the baseline for our group project, our team of five was tasked with developing and deploying a functional web app along the lines of food ordering apps such as Uber Eats, DoorDash, and so on. Together with the team's UX designer, I was also tasked with refreshing and solidifying the Lennox brand identity to better reflect the food truck's vision while also tying in some of the original design choices.</p>

            <p class="caption">Original Style Guide</p>
            <p>While we were provided with the initial design from the IDM 215 Lennox team, the final design changed from its initial existing wireframes to accommodate for new features that had yet to be built in the previous iteration, including a fully realized menu and user profile. Although our goal was to preserve most aspects of the original design to stay true to the original vision, we ultimately made several simple changes reflecting user testing feedback to improve the overall experience, such as expanding the app's colorway to improve the visual experience.</p>
